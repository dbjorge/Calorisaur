# It looks scary to include this, right? It's okay - in production, they just reference env vars
# config/secrets.yml

## Environment normalisation:
/.bundle
/vendor/bundle
/node_modules

# these should all be checked in to normalise the environment:
# Gemfile.lock, .ruby-version, .ruby-gemset

# unless supporting rvm < 1.11.0 or doing something fancy, ignore this:
.rvmrc

# normally, if using bower-rails ignore default bower_components path bower.json files
# we're using bower and rails but not bower-rails, because that works better with Heroku
/vendor/assets/bower_components
# *.bowerrc
# bower.json

# These are generated during asset precompilation
